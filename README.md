# GitHub Actions for EC2 Deployment with Nginx

This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process to an EC2 instance. The pipeline checks out the code, copies files to the EC2 instance, and restarts the Nginx web server. This is useful for continuous deployment to ensure your web application is automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
